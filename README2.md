# Dataset Import Challenges

## Difficulties Encountered

### Formatting Issues
- Adjusting delimiters and handling quotation marks in the CSV file to match MySQL Workbench's expectations.
- Resolving inconsistencies in line endings (e.g., `\r\n` vs. `\n`) to prevent parsing errors during import.

### Data Type Mismatches
- Mapping data types between the CSV file and MySQL table columns to ensure compatibility.
- Converting numeric values formatted as text in the CSV file to numeric types in MySQL.

### Encoding Problems
- Addressing encoding mismatches between the CSV file (e.g., UTF-8) and MySQL Workbench configuration to avoid character encoding errors.

### NULL Values Handling
- Defining strategies to manage NULL values during import to maintain data integrity and consistency.

### Performance Considerations
- Optimizing import processes for large CSV files to mitigate performance issues in MySQL Workbench and the MySQL server environment.
